# Hospital-Mnagement-System
This repository presents a code of my Fourth Semester Project of a basic console base Hospital Management System implemented in C#. The code demonstrates a simplified version of the system, focusing on patient management and appointment scheduling. It provides a foundation for building a comprehensive hospital management solution. 

The code includes classes for patients and appointments, along with functionalities such as adding patients, scheduling appointments, and viewing appointments. The console-based interface allows for easy interaction and testing. This code example serves as a starting point for developers looking to develop their own hospital management systems or gain insights into C# programming concepts for healthcare applications.
